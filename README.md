### 🌙 About Me

I'm a BSIT student at the **Colegio de Montalban**, but mostly I'm just a guy who finds joy in the deep, weird corners of computer science. My journey isn't about climbing a corporate ladder; it's about satisfying a relentless curiosity. Why does a JavaScript engine work the way it does? Can you store data in DNA? How tf does that one work? Can I try to build something like that?

These are the kinds of questions that lead me down rabbit holes. I'm not an expert—I'm just a tinkerer. Most of my projects are academic explorations, born from a desire to understand systems by building them from first principles.

- 🎓 **Currently:** Surmounting the BSIT grind. Life's catching up. 😿
- 🧪 **My Playground:** Web dev, systems programming, virtualization, security and sometimes DBs.
- 🦀 **Current Obsession:** Writing something in Rust and fighting the borrow checker _(The borrow checker is still winning, but I'm landing punches now)_.
- 🎨 **Confession:** I'm **BAD** at things I do.

### 🔭 My Research Playground

I like to build impractical but fascinating things. Here are a few of the rabbit holes I've gone down.

<br>


| Project | Description | Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[VortexJS](https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/vortex-js)** | An experimental JavaScript virtualization engine. It's a source-to-source compiler that transforms JS into a custom bytecode format, executed by a polymorphic, stackless virtual machine to explore software protection theory. | <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,nodejs&theme=dark&perline=2" /> |
| **[MirageFS](https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/mirage-fs)** | A high-stealth steganographic virtual block device. It mounts encrypted storage inside media (PNG/MP4/etc) via FUSE or WebDAV. Features a self-hosted Web UI, Hybrid RAID striping, and camouflages data as H.264 NAL-unit filler to defeat forensic analysis. | <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust&theme=dark&perline=1" /> |
| **[Helix](https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/helix)** | A systems-level DNA storage archiver. This compiler translates binary files into biostable DNA sequences, implementing a full storage stack including AES-256 encryption, Reed-Solomon error correction, and a Viterbi decoder for indel correction. | <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust,py&theme=dark&perline=2" /> |
| **[ChronosDB](https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/chronos-db)** | A distributed, vector-native, time-traveling database built in Rust. It combines HNSW for vector search, Raft for consensus, and a bi-temporal data model, allowing you to query the state of your data at any point in time. | <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust,docker&theme=dark&perline=2" /> |
| **[Project Aether](https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/project-aether)** | A user-space TCP/IP stack written from scratch in Rust to bypass the kernel. It's a raw, high-throughput experiment that prioritizes speed over reliability by stripping out features like retransmission and congestion control. | <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rust&theme=dark&perline=1" /> |
| **[Sigilus Security](https://github.com/SSL-ACTX/sigilus)** | A multi-stage, WebAssembly-based security framework for protecting web APIs. It uses a proof-of-execution challenge to provision a client-side request-signing WASM, making automated threats more difficult. | <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp,wasm,python,redis&theme=dark&perline=4" /> |

### 🛠 The Toolbox & Philosophy

My approach is simple: **build from scratch to truly understand.** I believe you can't claim to know a system until you've tried (and failed) to build a replica of it.

- **Languages:** I think in **Python** & **JavaScript**, but I'll write **Rust**, or **PHP** if the problem calls for it.
- **Backend & Data:** My go-to stack is **FastAPI** + **MongoDB**/**MySQL** + **Redis**. I'm also comfortable with **Node.js** and **Next.js** for full-stack work.
- **Systems & Low-Level:** This is where the real fun is. I enjoy designing **bytecode** for simple **custom VMs**, do something in `babel`, and exploring the guts of technologies like **WASM**.
- **Tools of the Trade:** I live in the terminal. My favorite editor is KDE **Kate** for its simplicity and power, but I fall back to **VSCode** when the Rust compiler starts yelling at me.

### ☕ Connect

I'm always open to talking shop about weird stuff, debating why Python is slow—you're st*pid, or just asking for manga recommendations. If you're working on something weird and interesting, feel free to reach out.
